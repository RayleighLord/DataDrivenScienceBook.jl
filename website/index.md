# Data-Driven Science and Engineering Book in Julia

\
This webpage contains a collection of the code from the lectures and homework using many interactive visualizations in Julia. The source code is presented in [Pluto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAF8DjrQSSk&ab_channel=TheJuliaProgrammingLanguage) notebooks, which are interactive tools suited to make learning more intuitive and be able to try different ideas very fast.

To set up Pluto, you can watch a quick guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOjKEgbt8AI&t=1s&ab_channel=TheJuliaProgrammingLanguage), which also covers how to install Julia.
