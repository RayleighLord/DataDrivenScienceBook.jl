This repository contains a collection of the code from the lectures, homework and many interactive visualizations in Julia. The source code is presented in [Pluto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAF8DjrQSSk&ab_channel=TheJuliaProgrammingLanguage) notebooks, which are interactive tools suited to make learning more intuitive and be able to try different ideas very fast.

To set up Pluto, you can watch a quick guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOjKEgbt8AI&t=1s&ab_channel=TheJuliaProgrammingLanguage), which also covers how to install Julia.

The content of this repository is based on the second edition of the excellent book:

Data-Driven Science And Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control
by S. L. Brunton and J. N. Kutz
