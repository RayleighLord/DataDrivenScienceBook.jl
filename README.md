# Data-Driven Science and Engineering Book in Julia

This repository contains a collection of the code from the lectures, homework and many interactive visualizations in Julia accessible from [this webpage](https://rayleighlord.github.io/DataDrivenScienceBook.jl/).

The source code is presented in [Pluto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAF8DjrQSSk&ab_channel=TheJuliaProgrammingLanguage) notebooks, which are interactive tools suited to make learning more intuitive and be able to try different ideas very fast. To set up Pluto, you can watch a quick guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOjKEgbt8AI&t=1s&ab_channel=TheJuliaProgrammingLanguage), which also covers how to install Julia. The Pluto notebooks can be directly downloaded from the webpage or, additionally, you can find them in the notebooks folder of this repository.

The content of this repository is based on the second edition of the excellent book:
